Introduction
------------

This application queries the [IATI Registry API](iatiregistry.org) for URLs of data recorded on the registry, and then downloads that data.

The application is just 2 scripts that you run one after the other:

 * `grab_urls.py` queries the registry and creates a text file called "downloads.curl" of curl commands for downloading the data. It also optionally downloads dataset metadata. If you donâ€™t want to download dataset metadata, run:

    ```
    python grab_urls.py --skip-metadata
    ```
 * `fetch_data.sh` runs the generated downloads.curl file, and logs any errors encountered.

IATI Registry Refresher requires python 3.

It also requires curl.
